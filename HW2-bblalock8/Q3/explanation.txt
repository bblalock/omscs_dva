The scatterplot for budget versus ratings has heavy class overlap. Wins and nominations versus rating has less overlap; e.g. there are almost no bad rating movies with more than forty wins and nominations. Therefore, wins and nominations versus rating is better at bifurcating good from bad movies 
In the presence of heavily skewed data visualizing values on a logarithmic scale can be beneficial to compensate.  Furthermore, if we want to visualize percent change and multiplicative factors we could use different scales, including the square root scale.
