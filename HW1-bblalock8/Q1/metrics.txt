Average degree: 2.833
The average number of connections per node; e.g. each movie is connected on average to approximately 3 other movies.

Network diameter: 24
The longest shortest path in the network; i.e. the scale of the network, specifically the breadth of its largest component, can be measured through the networkâ€™s diameter.

Average path length: 7.558
The average length of the shortest paths in the network; i.e. the connectivity of the network, or how connected two movies are on average, can be measured with average path length.
